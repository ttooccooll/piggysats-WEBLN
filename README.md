This is a UI for an LNBITS wallet that's meant to look like a piggy bank. Children can track their deposits but don't have the ability to withdrawal. It is meant to function like a physical piggy bank and the parents can always go back to the original LNBITS url and withdrawal when a large enough amount of money has been accumulated to place somewhere more secure. There are a few other fun learning links and various real-time stats for the network.

Big thanks to plebdevs.com and their plebdev course, where I learned how to make lightning wallets!
